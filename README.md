# Landing Page Plugin

## Install

#### 1.) Download the plugin

* Press the big greed "Code" button on this page then click `Download Zip`.
* Unzip it.

#### 2.) Install it in Chrome

* Go to 'manage extensions' by clicking the jigsaw piece looking icon in the top right hand corner of your broswer. If you don't have one, you can get still to 'manage extensions' by clicking the pill (three vertical dots - also in that corner) then settings, then extensions.
* Turn Developer Mode on with the toggle in the top right hand corner of the page.
* Click "load unpacked" and navigate to the directory you unzipped earlier then select the "extension" directory and press open.
* The plugin should now be installed.

Note - if it doesn't appear on your bar you can click the little jigsaw piece and you plugins will be listed - you can use the pill next to each to each plugin to pin any that you want to always be visible (do this for the landing page plugin).

## Usage

If we definetly don't have a scraper for the url you're looking at then the icon will fade out.

If we do have a scraper (or if we _might_ have a scraper) the icon will unfade and you'll be able to click it - doing so will provide more details in one of three ways:

* A working scraper will provide a scrape of some basic info.
* A broken scraper will tell you it's not working and link to a github issue where you can note the problem url.
* Where we have a scraper but it doesnt quite match the url you're looking at, it'll let you know and will provide the related urls that we can scrape.
